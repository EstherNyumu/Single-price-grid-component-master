## My process

I started by putting the text in their requred elements and arraging them in one column. If a text is supposed to be a heading I placed it into either h1/h2. I created a file for the CSS code and linked it with the HTML file. I started styling the texts with the required color of the text. I had initially used div in the elements that have the same font color. I then imported the required font for the text and then wrapped the elements in a box as rrequired and put the three boxes in a wrapper and added a box shadow. I also added the background colour of the boxes and placed the border as zero. After doing the desktop design I did the mobile design. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Wrapper/container property 

### What I learned

I learned how to use a flexbox even though I didn't use it. I'll practice using it in my next project.   

### Continued development

I would like to learn more on how to use the flexbox and improve in mobile design.

### Useful resources

- [https://hookagency.com/blog/html-wrapper-tutorial/] - This helped me understand how to implement using a wrapper.
The explanation and the video was helpful as i was able to style the wrapper how i want using CSS. i will be using this concept from now on.
- [https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_container.asp] - I didn't use a flexbox but this helped me understand oter flex properties such as flex-direction,align-items:space-around/between.I didn't use most of the properties but I was able to understand how and where they can be used.
